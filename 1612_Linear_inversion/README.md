# Linear inversion

There are four notebooks. The main one, that follows [the manuscript](manuscript/TLELinearinversion.pdf) most closely, is the IPython/NumPy version. The others implement the same workflow, more or less, in Lua/Torch7, in Julia, and in R.

- [NumPy](NumPy.ipynb)
- [Torch](Torch.ipynb)
- [Julia](Julia.ipynb)
- [R](R.ipynb)
