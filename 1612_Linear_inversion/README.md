# Linear inversion

These notebooks accompany the article in the December 2016 issue of _[The Leading Edge](http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/tle35121085.1)_.

There are four notebooks. The main one, that follows [the manuscript](manuscript/TLELinearinversion.pdf) most closely, is the IPython/NumPy version. The others implement the same workflow, more or less, in Lua/Torch7, in Julia, and in R.

- **[NumPy](NumPy.ipynb)** — Python language with NumPy numerics
- **[Torch](Torch.ipynb)** — Lua language with Torch7 numercics
- **[Julia](Julia.ipynb)** — Julia programming language
- **[R](R.ipynb)** — R programming language
